    "In recent years, OpenAI has emerged as a market leader in creating AI models, such as GPT-4, and releasing them to the wider community in applications like ChatGPT. These advancements not only revolutionize the way we work but also significantly influence the products and services companies offer to their clients. To tap into the potential of OpenAI's technology, it's crucial to familiarize oneself with its Application Programming Interface, or API. This notebook provides practical examples in utilizing the OpenAI API within Python, covering its extensive capabilities for solving real-world challenges, enhancing both personal and business solutions."

    "\n",
    "System examples: \n",
    "1. You are a data scientist that explains hard concepts in basic words\n",
    "2. Your answer should not exceed 50 words, and they should be accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "User examples:\n",
    "1. What is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
    "2. Explain prompt engineering in simple terms with fewer than 50 words\n",

    "1. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems, involving tasks like learning, reasoning, and self-correction.\n",
    "2. Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or instructions to guide AI systems in generating specific, accurate responses. It's like carefully choosing your words to get the exact answer or outcome you desire from a conversation.\n",
